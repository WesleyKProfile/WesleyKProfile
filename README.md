I'm an enthusiastic new grad with a B.S. in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance, and am excited by the prospect of solving new challenges and learning everything I can about the field of IT/cybersecurity. I'm eager to apply the knowledge and skills I've acquired in the classroom to real-world scenarios.
